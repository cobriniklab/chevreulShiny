# Preprocessing

Preprocessing is split into two major workflows: `sce_clustering_workflow` and `integration_workflow`. 

1. `sce_clustering_workflow` is designed for a single sequencing batch

2. `integration workflow` takes multiple batches presented as separate seurat objects then integrates to a single object.
